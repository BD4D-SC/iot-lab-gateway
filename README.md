### Running tests or deploying ###

Install all the `gateway code` on a gateway

        python setup.py release

It runs the `install` command and the `post_install` procedure.


Run unit tests, pylint and pep8:

        python setup.py tests


Run full integration tests (should be run on a gateway):

        python setup.py integration


Run the roomba specific integration tests

        python setup.py test_roomba


Server REST (testing)
---------------------

* launch server REST: `./server_rest.py localhost 8080`
* start experiment:   `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" http://localhost:8080/exp/start/123/clochette -F "firmware=@idle.elf" -F "profile=@tata.json"; echo`
* flash open node:    `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" http://localhost:8080/open/flash -F "firmware=@idle.elf"; echo`
